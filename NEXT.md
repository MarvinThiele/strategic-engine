Critical Next Steps (My Recommendation)
I'd suggest we focus on deepening the tactical layer first before expanding to operational/strategic, because:
The tactical layer is the "fun core" - if individual engagements aren't compelling, the rest won't matter
It's easier to scale UP than refactor DOWN - getting the unit-level simulation right now will make everything else easier
Vertical slice philosophy - make one small thing amazing before making everything mediocre
Phase 1: Make Tactical Combat Actually Interesting üéØ
A. Multi-Domain Warfare (Most Important IMO)
- Air units (CAP, CAS, SEAD)
- Artillery (indirect fire, counter-battery)
- Recon/ISR (UAVs, scouts affecting fog of war)
- Electronic warfare (jamming, datalink disruption)
- Terrain effects (cover, elevation, line of sight)
B. Asymmetric Unit Types
- Tanks, IFVs, infantry, AT teams, SAMs, artillery
- Different sensor types (visual, radar, thermal)
- Ammunition types (APFSDS, HEAT, HE)
- Unit formations and facing
C. Fog of War & Intelligence
- Units only see what their sensors detect
- Delayed/degraded information
- Electronic warfare effects
- Recon missions to reveal enemy positions
Phase 2: Operational Layer Connection üó∫Ô∏è
D. Persistent Multi-Battle Campaign
- Multiple linked battlefields (like your 30x30km theater idea)
- Units persist between engagements (damage, ammo, fatigue)
- Supply lines and logistics
- Reinforcements and reserves
E. Mission-Based Gameplay
- Objectives beyond "kill everything" (hold ground, breakthrough, delay)
- Time-sensitive operations
- Combined arms coordination bonuses
Phase 3: Strategic Layer (Later)
- Production and R&D
- Diplomacy and politics
- Economic modeling
- Grand theater view
My Specific Recommendation for Next Session
Let's implement terrain and line-of-sight first. Here's why:
It makes combat immediately more tactical - positioning matters
It's visual and satisfying - you'll see units using cover
It's foundational - everything else (artillery arcs, air strikes, etc.) builds on this
It's a reasonable scope - we can do this in one session
What This Would Look Like:
# Add to the map
- Elevation data (hills, valleys)
- Cover types (urban, forest, open)
- Line-of-sight calculations
- Movement speed modifiers by terrain

# Gameplay impact
- Units in forest: harder to detect, slower movement
- Units on hills: better vision range, worse cover
- Urban areas: close combat, limited visibility
- Artillery can fire over hills, direct fire cannot
Then in the UI, we'd show:
Terrain overlays (topographic colors, forest shading)
LOS indicators (can I see that enemy?)
Covered/exposed status for units
Alternative: If You Want "Width" Instead of "Depth"
If you'd rather see more of the vision come together (even if shallow), we could instead:
Build a simple operational map (10x10 grid of tactical battles)
Add basic unit persistence (HP/ammo carries over)
Create a "campaign mode" where you fight a series of linked battles
This would feel more like the full vision, but each layer would be simpler.
My Question to You
What excites you more right now? Option A: "I want individual battles to feel like a real wargame" ‚Üí Add terrain, fog of war, unit types Option B: "I want to see the operational layer come alive" ‚Üí Multi-battle campaigns, persistent units, supply Option C: "I want more units and combined arms" ‚Üí Add air units, artillery, different unit types Option D: "Something else" ‚Üí Tell me what you're most excited to see! I'm personally leaning toward Option A (terrain + LOS) because it's the foundation for everything else and will make the current system immediately more fun. But you're the designer - what gets you most hyped? üöÄ
